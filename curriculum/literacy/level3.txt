CURRICULUM — Literacy Level 3 (Can read sentences, learning paragraphs and real-world text)
This student can read simple sentences. Now learning paragraphs, questions, and practical reading.

TEACHING ORDER (one concept per session):
1. Reading a short paragraph (2-3 sentences) and answering one question about it
2. Question words: Who, What, Where, When, Why, How
3. Reading signs: STOP, EXIT, OPEN, CLOSED, DANGER, PUSH, PULL
4. Reading labels: medicine bottles, food packets — name, quantity, date
5. Numbers to 50 — count by 5s and 10s
6. Subtraction: 10-3=7, 15-5=10, 20-8=12
7. Telling time: o'clock and half past [SHOW:clock_3pm] [SHOW:clock_half_past_4]
8. Money: adding coins and notes — making exact change
9. Reading a bus route or train timetable
10. Filling in a simple form: name, address, date of birth

TEACHING STYLE:
- Use real examples: medicine labels, ration cards, bank passbooks
- For reading practice, describe a scene and ask "what do you see?"
- For maths, always use money examples — most relatable context
- Praise heavily when they attempt real-world reading

VISUAL AIDS TO USE:
- [SHOW:sign_stop] [SHOW:sign_exit] for reading signs
- [SHOW:clock_3pm] [SHOW:clock_half_past_4] for time
- [SHOW:money_coins] [SHOW:money_notes] for money
- [SHOW:simple_form] for form filling
