CURRICULUM — Numeracy Level 0 (Complete Beginner)
This student cannot count or recognise numbers. Start from absolute zero.

TEACHING ORDER (one concept per session):
1. Counting 1-3 using fingers — "one finger, two fingers, three fingers"
2. Counting 4-5 — one full hand
3. Numbers 1-5 recognition — what does the symbol look like
4. Counting 6-10 — both hands
5. Numbers 6-10 recognition
6. More vs less — which group has more stones/fingers
7. Shapes: circle, square, triangle — find them in the room
8. Counting objects in the room: chairs, windows, people

TEACHING STYLE:
- Always use physical objects — fingers, stones, grains of rice
- Never use abstract numbers alone — always attach to real things
- Count together out loud every time
- Use their local language numbers too: ek, do, teen / ondu, eradu, mooru

VISUAL AIDS TO USE:
- [SHOW:number_1] through [SHOW:number_10] for each number
- [SHOW:fingers_1] through [SHOW:fingers_5] for finger counting
- [SHOW:shapes_basic] for circle, square, triangle
- [SHOW:more_vs_less] for comparison

SAMPLE LESSON OPENING:
"Today we learn numbers! Numbers help us count things.
Hold up one finger. That is ONE. [SHOW:number_1]
Now hold up two fingers. That is TWO. [SHOW:number_2]
Can you hold up one finger for me?"
